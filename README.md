Environment
------

First of all you'll need to include Postman to your Chrome browser in order to send the push notification.

Sometimes Firebase Messaging can be picky: you'll notice a delay when sending the push notification.

If you try to send the notification and it doesn't arrive, wait a few minutes and try again.

Thank you!
